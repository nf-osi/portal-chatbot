"Which metadata files are needed when uploading data to Synapse?",{"choices":["Individual metadata only","Biospecimen metadata only","Assay metadata only","All metadata files: individual, biospecimen, assay, and a manifest","Manifest file only"],"labels":[0,0,0,1,0]},"CONTRIBUTOR","https://help.nf.synapse.org/NFdocs/metadata","All data that gets uploaded into Synapse is curated by the NF-OSI to ensure the metadata properly allows for data usability. In most cases, the required metadata will be expected in four files: 1. Individual metadata 2. Biospecimen metadata 3. Assay metadata 4. A manifest: a .tsv (tab-delimited text) file listing each file that will be uploaded, used to upload the data after it has been validated and approved"

"How often is ProjectLIVE updated for Sage internal milestone or progress report tracking?",{"choices":["Monthly","Bi-Yearly","Annually","Daily","Not covered in documentation"],"labels":[0,1,0,0,0]},"FUNDER","https://help.nf.synapse.org/NFdocs/faqs","For \"internal milestone\" tracking, projectLive updates daily for studies whose data sharing plans have been added to Synapse and updated. Addition of new data sharing plans occur once every 6 months."

"What type of findings may still require data sharing even if considered 'negative results'?",{"choices":["Failed experiments due to contamination","Usable data with no observed differences","Data with no metadata","Inconclusive study results","Not covered in documentation"],"labels":[0,1,0,0,0]},"CONTRIBUTOR","https://help.nf.synapse.org/NFdocs/frequently-asked-questions","If “failed” means no difference was observed, then yes. Negative results are valuable to the field, and it may be helpful to people in the future who are considering doing the same or similar experiment."
"Where are annotations applied before being visible in NF Data Portal?",{"choices":["Directly on the NF Data Portal","On the associated publication","Within the Synapse storage platform","In the project's final report","Not covered in documentation"],"labels":[0,0,1,0,0]},"CONTRIBUTOR","https://help.nf.synapse.org/NFdocs/frequently-asked-questions","In Synapse and the NF Data Portal, annotations live alongside files."
"What is one primary benefit of using metadata standards in research data?",{"choices":["They replace the need for detailed methods in publications","Enhance the data's visual quality","Ensure data understandability and reuse","Make data downloadable in different formats","Not covered in documentation"],"labels":[0,0,1,0,0]},"REUSER","https://help.nf.synapse.org/NFdocs/metadata","Metadata gives context to the data, allowing it to be understood by others, including those who were not involved in the data generation process."
